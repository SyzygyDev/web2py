                               This is group coaching but with individual attention always. You will be given a diet plan, daily goals and a workout plan to follow. No being hungry and no suffering, I promise. Interaction with the rest of the members takes place over a closed Facebook group. It is encouraged that you use this space to ask your questions and share your successes. The extra support of the group environment is truly invaluable. This is a great option for those who thrive on working with a like-minded community of people working toward the same goal. Vacations and special events are acceptable so don’t let that be your excuse. This is a motivational, fun group with lots of laughs along the way. Start date is the first of each month but sign up before the 1st so we can get you prepped. Many of my online group participants choose a couple of personal training sessions at the beginning of the month to kick start their program and to learn the exercises.

					<h4>Reverse your stress, improve brain function, build self image, and feel eurphoric.</h4>
					<p>Exercise has proven to reduce stress by increasing levels of "soothing" brain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Exercise will increases the level of brain chemicals called growth factors, which help make new neural cells. Being fit means you feel better about yourself and will see yourself setting new goals you had not thought of before. It will be my pleasure to help you on your journey of fitness and happiness! </p>
